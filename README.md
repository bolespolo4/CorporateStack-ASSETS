- **Flutter** ‚Äì Frontend (Dart)
- **Firebase / Node.js** ‚Äì Backend (Choose your preferred backend)
- **Stripe / Razorpay / PayPal** ‚Äì Payment Integration
- **Bloc** ‚Äì State Management
- **REST API** ‚Äì Backend Communication

## üèõ Clean Architecture & Bloc Design Pattern
This application follows the **Clean Architecture** principle, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The core structure is divided into:
- **Presentation Layer** ‚Äì UI components and BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management.
- **Domain Layer** ‚Äì Use cases and business logic.
- **Data Layer** ‚Äì API calls, repositories, and local storage.

Using the **Bloc Pattern**, the app ensures a predictable state management approach by following:
1. **Events** ‚Äì User interactions trigger events.
2. **Bloc** ‚Äì Business logic processes events and updates state.
3. **States** ‚Äì UI listens for state changes and rebuilds accordingly.

This approach improves scalability, testability, and code organization.
